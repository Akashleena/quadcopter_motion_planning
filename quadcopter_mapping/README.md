# Quadcopter Mapping Package

Made by Rumaisa Abdulhai

## Description

This package launches the gmapping node for the quadcopter to map the environment. It also contains the maps that were constructed using the node and a configured rviz file that displays current laser scans and the map as it is being continuously updated during the mapping process.

**Note**: A linux machine running ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04 were used to make this package. This code is not guaranteed to work for other ROS versions, but many packages used in this project are available in other ROS distros.
